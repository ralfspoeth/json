# Greyson

A small, opinionated JSON library for Java.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.github.ralfspoeth</groupId>
    <artifactId>json</artifactId>
    <version>1.6.1</version>
</dependency>
```

No annotations. No reflection. No code generation. Greyson parses JSON
into immutable algebraic data types and gets out of your way. The whole
library, with dependencies, fits in under 100 kB.

If your project already pulls in Jackson, you don't need Greyson. But if
you've ever wanted a JSON library that you can read end-to-end in an
afternoon, that doesn't ask you to decorate your records, and that
treats `Optional` and `Stream` as first-class citizens rather than
afterthoughts — this is that library.

> same messy JSON with Greyson, Jackson, and Gson, see

## At a glance

```java
record Car(String make, int year) {}

Car car = Greyson.readValue(reader)
    .map(v -> new Car(
        v.get("make").flatMap(JsonValue::string).orElseThrow(),
        v.get("year").flatMap(JsonValue::intValue).orElseThrow()
    ))
    .orElseThrow();
```

Three things to notice:

- `readValue` returns `Optional<JsonValue>`. There are no nulls anywhere
  in the API.
- `JsonValue` is a sealed interface (`Basic | Aggregate`), so the
  compiler can prove your switches are exhaustive.
- Field extraction is just `Optional` chaining. No annotations on
  `Car`, no `TypeReference`, no `ObjectMapper` configuration.

Writing is the mirror image:

```java
JsonObject jo = Aggregate.objectBuilder()
    .putBasic("make", car.make())
    .putBasic("year", car.year())
    .build();

Greyson.writeValue(writer, jo);
```

## The duality: `JsonValue` ↔ `Builder`

Every `JsonValue` is immutable. Every `Builder` is its mutable twin.
The two are wired together so that round-tripping is always identity:

```java
JsonValue v = ...;
assert v.equals(v.builder().build());
```

This makes one-shot edits painless. To stamp a timestamp onto an
incoming object:

```java
Greyson.readBuilder(src)
    .filter(Builder.ObjectBuilder.class::isInstance)
    .map(Builder.ObjectBuilder.class::cast)
    .map(ob -> ob.putBasic("ts", Instant.now().toString()))
    .ifPresent(ob -> Greyson.writeBuilder(target, ob));
```

To wrap any incoming payload in an envelope:

```java
Greyson.readBuilder(src)
    .map(b -> objectBuilder()
        .putBasic("ts", Instant.now().toString())
        .put("msg", b))
    .ifPresent(ob -> Greyson.writeBuilder(target, ob));
```

Use `JsonValue` when you're mapping into your domain. Use `Builder`
when you're rewriting JSON in place.

## Real-world resilience

JSON in the wild is messy. Greyson treats single objects and arrays of
objects identically, ignores unknown keys without complaint, and lets
you mark fields mandatory or optional one at a time:

```java
record UserProfile(String id, List<String> tags, double balance) {}

static List<UserProfile> fromJson(Reader rdr) throws IOException {
    return Greyson.readValue(rdr).stream()
        .flatMap(Selector.all())                            // single object or array — both work
        .map(v -> new UserProfile(
            Pointer.self().member("id").stringValue(v).orElseThrow(),
            Pointer.self().member("tags").elements(v).stream()
                .flatMap(t -> t.string().stream())
                .toList(),
            Pointer.self().member("balance").doubleValue(v).orElse(0.0)
        ))
        .toList();
}
```

The same code accepts all of these without a configuration change:

```json
{"id": "p1", "tags": ["one", "two"]}
```

```json
[
    {"id": "p1", "tags": ["one", "two"]},
    {"id": "p2"},
    {"id": "p3", "balance": 100}
]
```

```json
{"id": "p4", "misspelled": "ignored", "balance": -500}
```

## Query API

Two abstractions, with a clear division of labor.

**`Selector`** is a function from `JsonValue` to `Stream<JsonValue>`.
Use it inside `Stream::flatMap` to pick out *a set of* values. Four
flavors ship in the box:

- `Selector.all()` — flattens an array, or yields the value itself
- `Selector.range(min, max)` — slices an array
- `Selector.regex(pattern)` — picks object members by key
- type filters — `objects()`, `arrays()`, `strings()`, `numbers()`,
  `booleans()`, `nulls()` (plus the abstract supertypes `basics()` and
  `aggregates()`); each yields its input if it matches the type, empty
  stream otherwise

Selectors stack:

```java
Greyson.readValue(src).stream()
    .flatMap(Selector.all())
    .flatMap(Selector.regex("a[0-9]*"))
    .flatMap(Selector.range(0, 2))
    .map(...);
```

**`Pointer`** is a function from `JsonValue` to `Optional<JsonValue>`.
Use it inside `Optional::flatMap` to navigate to *one* value. Build by
hand, or parse a slash-separated path:

```java
var p = Pointer.self().member("a").index(2).regex("b.*");
var q = Pointer.parse("a/[2]/#b.*");     // equivalent
```

Path syntax in `parse`:

- `name` — matches an object member by literal key
- `[n]` — indexes into an array (with optional leading `-` for
  from-the-end)
- `#regex` — matches an object member by regular expression; when
  several keys satisfy the pattern, the lexicographically smallest wins

The two forms are interchangeable; pick whichever reads more clearly at
the call site. Either way you get a `Pointer` you can plug straight
into a value extractor:

```java
JsonValue v = Greyson.readValue(src).orElseThrow();
boolean b = Pointer.parse("a/b/c").booleanValue(v).orElseThrow();
```

### JSON Pointer (RFC 6901)

Greyson reads
[RFC 6901](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6901) JSON Pointer
expressions via `Pointer.fromJsonPointer(String)`, so strings emitted
by JSON Patch, OpenAPI `$ref`, JSON Schema, or anything else that
speaks the standard drop straight in:

```java
var p = Pointer.fromJsonPointer("/users/0/email");
String email = p.stringValue(doc).orElseThrow();
```

Two nuances worth knowing:

- **Dispatch is dynamic.** The same token resolves as a member name
  against a `JsonObject` and as a non-negative integer index against a
  `JsonArray`. This differs from `parse`, which decides member-vs-index
  statically from the syntax. It's the price of RFC 6901 compatibility.
- **Escapes follow the spec.** `~1` decodes to `/` and `~0` to `~`, in
  that order, so a key like `a/b` is reachable via `/a~1b` and a key
  like `m~n` via `/m~0n`. The empty string addresses the document root.

### Updating a document

`Pointer` writes as well as reads. `with` returns a copy of the document
with the addressed value replaced; `without` returns a copy with it
removed. The original is never mutated — every off-path subtree is shared
with it, so the copies are cheap.

```java
var doc = Greyson.readValue(src).orElseThrow();
JsonValue renamed = Pointer.parse("data/users/[0]/name").with(doc, Basic.of("Ada"));
JsonValue pruned  = Pointer.parse("data/users/[0]/name").without(doc);
// doc is unchanged
```

Writes drive the same engine through both path dialects, so an RFC 6901
string works too — enough to implement JSON Patch `add`/`remove`/`replace`
on top:

```java
JsonValue patched = Pointer.fromJsonPointer("/data/users/0/active").with(doc, JsonBoolean.TRUE);
```

A few rules keep the semantics honest:

- **Missing object members are created.** Writing `a/b/c` into `{}`
  materialises the intermediate objects.
- **Arrays are not conjured.** An `[n]` step over a missing or non-array
  value throws `IllegalStateException`; an out-of-range index throws
  `IndexOutOfBoundsException`. An RFC 6901 index equal to the array length
  appends.
- **`#regex` segments don't write.** The target is ambiguous on a miss,
  so `with`/`without` throw `UnsupportedOperationException`; resolve to a
  concrete member first.
- **Removing and nulling are distinct.** `without` drops the slot;
  `with(doc, JsonNull.INSTANCE)` sets it to JSON `null`.

### Required extraction

Navigation returns `Optional`, which is right when a miss is a normal
outcome. When a value *must* be there, `require` throws instead — and
names the pointer, so the failure tells you where it missed:

```java
String name = Pointer.parse("data/users/[0]/name").stringOrThrow(doc);
// NoSuchElementException: no value at data/users/[0]/name
//   (or)  value at data/users/[0]/name is a JsonNumber, not a string
```

`require(doc)` returns the raw `JsonValue`; the typed `…OrThrow` accessors
(`stringOrThrow`, `intOrThrow`, `longOrThrow`, `doubleOrThrow`,
`booleanOrThrow`, `decimalOrThrow`, plus `intExactOrThrow` /
`longExactOrThrow`) add the type check and separate "absent" from "wrong
type" in the message. They pair with the `Optional`-returning accessors —
`stringValue`/`stringOrThrow`, `intValue`/`intOrThrow`, `intExact`/
`intExactOrThrow`, and so on.

### Pointers as values

A `Pointer` renders to its `parse` syntax via `toString()`, and `equals`
/ `hashCode` compare the whole segment chain — by type *and* data. So
`self().member("x")` and `fromJsonPointer("/x")` are distinct (they
dispatch differently), and a member literally named `[0]` is not the
index `[0]`. Pointers are immutable and safe to use as map keys.

### Composing pointers and selectors

`Pointer` and `Selector` compose in either direction. Pick the entry
point by which side you're coming from.

```java
// "navigate to one place, then fan out from there"
//   Pointer → Selector
var users = Pointer.parse("data/users").select(Selector.all());
Stream.of(doc).flatMap(users).forEach(...);

// "fan out from many places, then narrow each one"
//   Selector → Pointer
var emails = Selector.all().point(Pointer.self().member("email"));
Stream.of(usersArray).flatMap(emails).forEach(...);
```

`Pointer.select(Selector)` returns an empty stream when the pointer
doesn't resolve. `Selector.point(Pointer)` silently drops elements for
which the pointer doesn't resolve. In both cases, missing data is
absent from the output rather than a thrown exception.

## Data model

```
JsonValue                       sealed
├── Basic                       sealed
│   ├── JsonBoolean             record(boolean)
│   ├── JsonNumber              record(BigDecimal)
│   ├── JsonString              record(String)
│   └── JsonNull                record()
└── Aggregate                   sealed
    ├── JsonArray               record(List<JsonValue>)
    └── JsonObject              record(Map<String, JsonValue>)
```

A few design choices worth calling out:

- **`BigDecimal`, not `double`.** Numbers are held as `BigDecimal`, so digits
  are never lost to binary floating point, and the value is kept exactly as
  written — scale and trailing zeros included — so `18250.00` serializes back as
  `18250.00` (via `BigDecimal::toPlainString`, never scientific notation).
  Equality is *numeric*: `18250.00` and `18250` are equal (compared with
  `BigDecimal::compareTo`), with `hashCode` kept consistent by stripping trailing
  zeros. `JsonValue::intValue`, `::longValue`, `::doubleValue` give you the
  conversions when you want them.
- **Defensive copies in canonical constructors.** `JsonArray` and
  `JsonObject` copy their inputs unless they're already immutable
  (`List.of`, `Map.of`). Once constructed, the whole tree is
  effectively immutable.
- **No nulls in the API.** Every method that could return "no value"
  returns `Optional`, an empty `List`, or an empty `Map`. `null` is
  tolerated as input wherever it makes sense.
- **Aggregates are functions.** `JsonObject implements Function<String,
  JsonValue>` and `JsonArray implements IntFunction<JsonValue>`, so you
  can pass them straight into stream pipelines.

---

## Reading and writing

The `Greyson` class is the entry point. Four methods, that's it.

```java
Optional<JsonValue>                      Greyson.readValue(Reader)
Optional<Builder<? extends JsonValue>>   Greyson.readBuilder(Reader)
void                                     Greyson.writeValue(Writer, JsonValue)
void                                     Greyson.writeBuilder(Writer, Builder<?>)
```

`readValue` throws `IOException` from the underlying reader. The write
methods rethrow as `UncheckedIOException` so you can use them inside
fluent chains.

To filter at parse time — say, reject anything that isn't a JSON object
with a required key set:

```java
return Greyson.readValue(src)
    .filter(JsonObject.class::isInstance)
    .filter(jv -> jv.members().keySet().containsAll(Set.of("year", "make")))
    .map(...)
    .orElseThrow();
```

---

## JPMS

If you're using the Java module system, Greyson's module name is
`io.github.ralfspoeth.greyson`:

```java
module your.module {
    requires io.github.ralfspoeth.greyson;
}
```

It exports four packages:

- `io.github.ralfspoeth.json` — the `Greyson` entry point
- `io.github.ralfspoeth.json.data` — `JsonValue` and friends
- `io.github.ralfspoeth.json.io` — `JsonReader`, `JsonWriter`, `JsonParseException`
- `io.github.ralfspoeth.json.query` — `Pointer`, `Selector`, `Queries`

---

## Conformance

Greyson's parser is exercised against the
[nst JSON Test Suite](https://github.com/nst/JSONTestSuite). Every
`y_*` (must accept) case parses; every `n_*` (must reject) case
rejects; the `i_*` (implementation-defined) cases are documented in
the test resources.

Greyson is not the fastest JSON library on the JVM. Jackson and Gson
use bespoke streaming parsers, intern strings, and skip allocation in
the hot path. Greyson allocates an algebraic data type for every node.
If your bottleneck is JSON parsing throughput, use Jackson. If it
isn't, the simplicity is worth the trade.

## What's new in 1.6.1

- `JsonNumber` now preserves a number's scale exactly as written rather than
  stripping trailing zeros, so `18250.00` round-trips as `18250.00` (not
  `18250`). Equality stays *numeric* — `18250.00` equals `18250` via
  `BigDecimal::compareTo` — with `hashCode` kept consistent by stripping trailing
  zeros before hashing. This reverses the normalization introduced in 1.4.4.

## What's new in 1.6.0

- `Pointer.decimalValue(JsonValue)` returns `Optional<BigDecimal>` — the
  `Optional`-returning twin of `decimalOrThrow`, completing the
  `xxxValue`/`xxxOrThrow` pairing for every JSON scalar type.

## What's new in 1.5.0

**Breaking change.** The `Pointer` throwing accessors are renamed from the
`requireXxx` family to a type-prefixed `xxxOrThrow` family, so they pair with
the `Optional`-returning `xxxValue` accessors and sort beside them. The raw
`require(JsonValue)` (returns `JsonValue`) keeps its name. Migration:

| 1.4.x | 1.5.0 |
| --- | --- |
| `requireString` | `stringOrThrow` |
| `requireDecimal` | `decimalOrThrow` |
| `requireInt` | `intOrThrow` |
| `requireLong` | `longOrThrow` |
| `requireDouble` | `doubleOrThrow` |
| `requireBoolean` | `booleanOrThrow` |
| `requireIntExact` | `intExactOrThrow` |
| `requireLongExact` | `longExactOrThrow` |
| `require` | `require` *(unchanged)* |

The two `Optional`-returning exact accessors are also renamed for symmetry,
dropping the redundant `Value`: `intValueExact` → `intExact` and
`longValueExact` → `longExact` (so each pairs cleanly with `intExactOrThrow` /
`longExactOrThrow`). The other `xxxValue` accessors are unchanged.

## What's new in 1.4.4

- `JsonNumber` now serializes through `BigDecimal::toPlainString`, so numbers
  never appear in scientific notation: a value read as `18250.00` is written
  back as `18250` rather than `1.825E+4`. Numbers remain normalized (trailing
  zeros stripped), so the value compares equal either way — magnitude and
  significant digits are preserved, trailing-zero scale is not.

## What's new in 1.4.0

Version 1.4.0 grows `Pointer` from a read-only navigator into a full
read/write query primitive, developed with the help of Claude. Everything
below is new since 1.3.2.

- `Pointer.with(root, value)` and `Pointer.without(root)` update a document
  by returning a modified immutable copy, sharing every off-path subtree.
  Missing object members are auto-created; an `[n]` index step requires an
  existing array; `#regex` segments are not writable. RFC 6901 pointers
  drive the same engine, enough to implement JSON Patch on top.
- A `require*` family extracts a required value, throwing a
  `NoSuchElementException` that names the pointer and distinguishes an
  unresolved path from a wrong-typed value: `require`, `requireString`,
  `requireDecimal`, `requireInt`, `requireIntExact`, `requireLong`,
  `requireLongExact`, `requireDouble`, and `requireBoolean`.
- `Pointer` now implements `toString()` (rendering its `parse` syntax) plus
  `equals`/`hashCode` over the segment chain, compared by type and data — so
  pointers print legibly and work as map keys.

## What's new in 1.3

Version 1.3 incorporates changes with the help of Claude.

- `README.md` has been rewritten
- `Lexer` and therefore the `JsonReader` have gained some speed-up
- `Pointer.fromJsonPointer(String)` reads RFC 6901 JSON Pointer
  expressions, for interop with JSON Patch, OpenAPI `$ref`, JSON Schema,
  and other tooling that emits the standard syntax
- `Pointer.regex(...)` resolves multi-match patterns deterministically:
  when several keys match, the lexicographically smallest one wins
- `Pointer.select(Selector)` and `Selector.point(Pointer)` compose the
  two query primitives in either direction
- `Selector.objects()`, `arrays()`, `strings()`, `numbers()`,
  `booleans()`, `nulls()`, `basics()`, and `aggregates()` filter a
  stream to a single JSON value type
